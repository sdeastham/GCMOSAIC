! Model         : MOSAIC (Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions & Chemistry)
!
! Last Update   : October 2007
!
! Sub-Modules   : CBM-Z  (gas-phase photochemistry)
!                 ASTEM  (Adaptive Step Time-split Euler Method)
!                 MESA   (Multicomponent Equilibrium Solver for Aerosols)
!                 MTEM   (Multicomponent Taylor Expansion Method for activity coefficients)
!
! Purpose       : CBM-Z simulates lower tropospheric trace gas photochemistry for
!                 background, urban, biogenic, and marine (DMS) sub-regimes.
!
!                 ASTEM solves the dynamic partitioning of semi-volatile
!                 species between gas and particle phases.
!
!                 MESA solves the multicomponent solid-liquid equilibria within
!                 the aerosol phase.
!
!                 MTEM computes the multicomponent activity coefficients of
!                 electrolytes in aqueous atmospheric aerosols.

*COMPILE*
Type "compile.sh" to complile and generate an executable "mosaic.x"
the code will be compiled with the Portland Group Fortan90 Compiler using the
following options:

-fast -byteswapio -Ktrap=fp

The user should edit the Makefile to compile the code with a different compiler
and/or different options


*CLEAN*
Type "clean.sh" to remove all the mosaic.x, *.o and *.mod files 
Then do "compile.sh" to do a fresh compile


*EXECUTE*
Type "mosaic.x" to run the model.


*INPUT*
Input files are stored in the same folder as mosaic.x (e.g., case1.inp, case2.inp, etc.)
Just type the name of the file (e.g., case1.inp) at the prompt "Enter input filename"


*OUTPUT*
The output files (e.g., case1.gas.txt, case1.bin001.txt, case1.dist.species.txt, 
case1.dist.dry.txt, case1.dist.wet.txt, etc.) will be created and stored in the ./output folder

The unit for species concentration in *.gas.txt files is ppbv
The unit for species concentration in *.bin001.txt and other aerosol files is nmol/m^3 (air) or ng/m^3 (air)
